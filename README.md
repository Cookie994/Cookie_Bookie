CRUD RESTful API for recipe book <br>
I did this project thanks to Brad Traversy and his tutorial on how to make PHP REST API (with some changes).
Functionalities include: creating a new recipe, updating/deleting old ones, search for a specific keyword.
Written in <b>PHP, jQuery and AJAX for pulling data, SASS and Bootstrap 5 for front-end.</b>
